## Architecture Notes

The system revolves around a planning agent that slices work into auditable tasks. Each task is executed by a specialized worker agent that writes code, drafts tests, and surfaces assumptions. A reviewer agent validates linting, security posture, and runtime sanity before the change moves forward.

## Operational Flow

1. Collect a goal description and convert it into discrete work units.
2. Launch concurrent coding agents guarded by a shared knowledge base.
3. Run reviewer checks (linters, unit tests, dependency diff) before accepting patches.
4. Summarize outcomes and feed them back into the planner for the next iteration.

## Next Steps

- Harden the knowledge base to support incremental context pruning.
- Integrate reinforcement signals for agents that consistently ship reliable diffs.
- Expand the reviewer skillset with lightweight static analysis.
