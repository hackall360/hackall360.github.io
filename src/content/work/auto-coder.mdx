**Problem.** Teams were bypassing review with ad-hoc AI scripts, committing unvetted code and leaking environment variables into diffs. We needed a sanctioned path that preserved velocity while enforcing policy and auditability.

**Approach.** Built a gateway service that signs each generation request, injects repo-specific guardrails, and stores prompts + responses in Postgres for review. OPA policies gate prompt inputs, GitHub Actions verify signatures before merging, and Astro docs expose live telemetry for operators.

**Trade-offs.** Deferred IDE plug-ins to focus on CI-integrated flows. We intentionally limited model choice to approved endpoints so we could validate tokens and redact secrets aggressively.
